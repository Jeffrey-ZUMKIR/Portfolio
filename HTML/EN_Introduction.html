				<p>My name is Jeffrey Zumkir, I am 22 years old and I am actually studying at Ludus Academie in Strasbourg.</p>
				<p>I mainly study programming in C languages, web designing and game design. After working with the software Construct 2 to develop 2D games, I am learning how to work with Unreal 4. My objective is to acquire the knowledges to work on VR games.</p>
				<p>For video games and board games, three styles feet me the most. The first one is strategy games; I love having to think and plan my actions. The second one is management games; very active or quiet games like "Stardew Valley". And finally cooperative games; I really like playing in group.</p>
				<p>In terms of languages, after spending a year in the USA, I have mastered the B2+ level.</p>
				<p>For graphisms, I am practicing pixel arts to bring a personality to my 2D projects.</p>
				<p>In parallel to my studies, I am working with a company based on network marketing. There, I am learning how to take care of a team, manage my time. Every Saturday, I put in place short meetings where I am talking about a subject to motivate them. I am comfortable speaking in front an audience in person or by video.</p>
